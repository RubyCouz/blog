            We know youâ€™re waiting for more news regarding the Crucible. We have a few quick bits to share before launch and then, later in the season, we'll have the bigger article with more details on playlist changes coming with Lightfall and later, adjustments to competitive progression and rewards, and changes to how matchmaking will work in the near future.

            Next week, the Competitive Division freelance node is going away, as we believe fireteam matchmaking is solving the problem it was originally intended to solve, in a much healthier way. This will merge the player populations into one larger, healthier pool while still protecting smaller fireteams from getting stomped by larger more coordinated groups.
